# Advent of Code 2023 - C# Solutions

Welcome to my repository for Advent of Code 2023! ðŸŽ„ðŸŒŸ Here, I'll be sharing my solutions to the challenges in C#.
My Goal is in the first place to get as far as possible.
My secondary challenge is to try to refactor the code to a good quality and to finesse the knowlegde i gathered till now.

## Structure

- Each day's solution is organized in its own folder, named "adventofcodeXX," where XX corresponds to the day.
- The C# code is structured using a simple console application, making it easy to understand and run.


Feel free to explore the code and i would love if you provide feedback or suggest improvements. Happy coding! ðŸš€

DISCLAIMER: I am still a Student, so my solutions may (are) not be best practice!
