This Design is based on the Code of Vinzenz Alb

To Be Fair, I did understand the task, but my code did work, did the testinput perfectly fine but the real input just exceeded my available memory while working. If i wont forget it i will also push my old code to github under the name "AnotherApproach.cs" later

edit: i found my mistake in my code while iterative debugging with reduced data, accidentally saving everthing double and triple wont help the cause
